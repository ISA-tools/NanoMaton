NanoMaton
=========

NanoMaton is a java library relying on the [nanopub-java](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-java) code for converting a spreadsheet template into [nanopublications](http://nanopub.org/).

A Google spreadsheets template for NanoMaton can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/templates?q=nanomaton&sort=hottest&view=public). This template can be used in combination with [OntoMaton](https://github.com/ISA-tools/OntoMaton) to associate nanopublication elements to vocabulary terms. For more information, see the article on OntoMaton available in [Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/525.full), which describes how OntoMaton supports collaborative annotation and relies on NCBO Bioportal web services. Also note that OntoMaton version 2 has been extended to support annotations relying on the [Linked Open Vocabularies](http://lov.okfn.org/) services.

For an example on how to use NanoMaton to generate nanopublications, please see our [SOAPdenovo2 case study](http://isa-tools.github.io/soapdenovo2/), for which the completed NanoMaton template for 8 nanopublications can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmtKthYRS0f5dHFldVQ5cVRHT3lxU3FWUUlhNEZ5YkE&usp=drive_web#gid=7).
